      <p>I have a few projects I'm currently working on. But in my spare time, I like to indulge myself in the following: </p>

      <p>I spend a good portion of my time writing code and creating with technology. I design mostly everything for myself, and sometimes others, using Figma.</p>

      <h2 id="Music">Music!</h2>
      <p>When not working or sleeping or eating, I really like making noises on hollow pieces of wood, more commonly known as the cello. Occasionally, I can make some [nice sounding noises]. If I can't make pretty noises, I'll just watch and listen to professionals. </p>
      <p>Even though I play cello, my taste is very multifaceted. I primarily listen to pop music, but I'll still listen to everything from classical to rock to hip hop. Here are some of my albums</p>
      <ul>

      <h2 id="Media">Media!</h2>
      <p>I enjoy engulfing myself in books and watching movies -- most of my favorites are either comedies or documentaries. <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7775622/">[Free Solo]</a>, which really took off in 2017. <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/">[La La Land]</a> is also a great one. And completely unrelated <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/">[The Social Network]</a>, which I've watched countless times. </p>
      <p>books</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>The Harry Potter series (can't go wrong with J.K. Rowling)</li>
        <li>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (a sci-fi fan-fiction</li>
        <li>Animal Farm by George Orwell</li>
        <li>Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</li> 
        <li>Holes by Louis Sachar</li>
        <li>The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As a kid, I did like, what, 6 sports? Hehe, well, life happens and now, I do zero sports. But maybe it was for the better.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy watching sports. I'm not a extreme supporter of anybody, nor do I follow a single sport too much. Still, I enjoy watching snowboarding, basketball, and swimming.</p>

      <p>I really like organizing things and helping others. </p>
      <p>Last summer, I co-led a summer program called AustinStrong to help kids of Austin during the pandemic :) I've also done some street performances with my friends, just playing in parks and in front of grocery stores. </p>
