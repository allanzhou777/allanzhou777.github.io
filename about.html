      <p>If you've explored the rest of this website, you know I have tons of side-projects ranging from creating websites to my own research. But in the spare time I have, I like to indulge myself in my many hobbies.</p>

      <h2 id="Music">Music!</h2>
      <p>When not working or sleeping or eating, I really like making noises on hollow pieces of wood, more commonly known as a cello. Occasionally, I can make some [nice sounding noises]. If I can't make nice noises, I watch and listen to professionals in absolute awe. </p>
      <p>My taste is very multifaceted, but I primarily listen to pop music. However, I'll still listen to everything from classical to rock to hip hop. Here are some of my albums</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5qVyC52Vz3AYgbUmtR1il5?si=dbd4dc7358734b24">[classical singles]</a></li>

      <p>As a kid, I did like, what, 6 sports? (Track and field, soccer, basketball, swimming, gymnastics, and tennis). Now? Zero. Maybe I had potential, but life goes on. </p>
      <p>Not only did I play a lot of sports, but I also enjoy watching sports. I really enjoy watching snowboarding, basketball (only Lamelo Ball though), and swimming.</p>
