      World map
    </h1>
  </section>


  <p>On the first day of Human Geography (or one of the first few days), I saw a map in Mr. Gaslow's room which had the countries sized by population. It looked something like this. </p>
  <img src="\photos\photos_map\map_by_population.webp" alt="world map by country population" style="width:30em;height:auto;">
  <p>And as it turns out, we had a unit later that year on maps. Apparently, there are also maps that use color intensity to show something, like population density or per-capita stuff. Anyhow, I found it pretty fascinating. </p>
  <p>I also found it very intersting how there isn't a single map that is 100% accurate if you draw it on 2d paper. I guess this is somewhat reasonable to think, but once you think about it, map projections do serve a pretty improtant role.</p>
  <p>The first map we learned was the Mercator projection, which is the most commonly used one, and also the one that my teacher dislikes the most. After a bit of research, you'll see that this map was made by the British Empire, and exaggerated the amount of land that they occupied (mainly by enlarging the Northern hemisphere). Others argue that even though it is the most popular, it just so happens to perpetuate the view that developing countries are inferior.</p>
  <p>I'm gonna be honest. I initially didn't care about these maps, but after much debate in our classes about the best one, I figured you could probably just create your own map???</p>
  <p>And instead of making it as accurate as possible, I'm going to make it as inaccurate as possible, perhaps for entertainment purposes. You can visit the website here <a href = "https://allanzhou777.github.io/map/WORLDMAP.html">[Very Accurate World Map]</a>.</p>
  <p>On this website you can view:</p> 
  <ol>
    <li>A map where every country has the same size, and everybody is equal :)</li>
    <img src="\photos\photos_map\map_equal_size.png" alt="world map all countries are equally sized" style="width:30em;height:auto;">

    <li>A map of potentially a US nightmare, where Russia, China, and North Korea are all humongous :)</li>
    <img src="\photos\photos_map\map_us_nightmare.png" alt="world map but Russia China and North korea are huge" style="width:30em;height:auto;">

    <li>Perhaps a map where Australia is massive. Personally, I dont' see anything wrong with this :)</li>
    <img src="\photos\photos_map\map_australia.png" alt="world map but australia is huge" style="width:30em;height:auto;">
  </ol>
  <p>Again, you can visit the website <a href = "https://allanzhou777.github.io/map/WORLDMAP.html">[Here]</a>.</p>
