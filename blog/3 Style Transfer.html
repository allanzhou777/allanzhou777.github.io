  <p>In part 2, we introduced the inputs and outputs of this technology, the algorithmic nature of neural style transfer, and the model architecture surrounding it. This leads us to Part 3 of this series: the use cases and applications</p>
  <p>We’ve mentioned several of them in previous sections, but here we’ll dive a bit deeper and explore the impact this computer vision technique can have across industries. Specifically, we’ll examine how style transfer can be used in the following areas: </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Photo and video editors</li>
      <li>Commercial art</li>
      <li>Gaming</li>
      <li>Virtual reality</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a id = "Photo and video editing">Photo and Video Editors</a></h2>
  <p>One of the clearest applications of style transfer is in photo and video editing software. From sharing stylized selfies to augmenting user-generated music videos, and beyond, the ability to add famous art styles to images and video clips promises to add unprecedented power to these kinds of creativity tools.</p>
  <p>And given the flexibility and performance of current deep learning approaches, style transfer models can easily be embedded on edge devices—for instance, mobile phones—allowing for applications that can process and transform images and video in real-time. This means that professional-quality photo and video editing tools can become more widely accessible and easier to use than ever before.</p>
  <p>There are already a number of incredible tools that employ style transfer as part of their toolkits. Here are a few fun projects, apps, and demos to play with:</p>
  
  <h2><a id = "Commercial Art">Commercial Art</a></h2>
  <p>From poetry to artwork to music, we’ve only just entered the era of AI creations. And style transfer is one of the computer vision technology making this wave of AI-powered artwork possible.</p>
  <p>Whether it’s artwork sold at a high-end auction or up-and-coming artists finding new ways to share their aesthetic with the world, style transfer promises to change the ways we think about art, what originality means, and how we present art in the real world.</p>
  <p>We could also imagine style transfer being used to create reproducible, high-quality prints for office buildings, or for large-scale advertising campaigns. These are just a few possible ways in which style transfer could change how we view the commercial impacts of art.</p>
  
  <h2><a id = "Gaming">Gaming</a></h2>
  <p>At a press conference during the 2019 Game Developers Conference, Google introduced Stadia, its cloud-powered video game streaming service. And one of the primary features included in that demo was an in-game style transfer feature that automatically recomposes the virtual world with textures and color palettes from a potentially limitless range of art styles.</p>
  <p>Google noted that efforts like these are intended to “empower the artist inside of every developer.” This implies that gaming, much like other applications of style transfer, will broaden the accessibility of artistic creation to those who we might not traditionally see as artists.</p>
  
  <h2><a id = "Virtual Reality">Virtual Reality</a></h2>
  <p>Much like gaming, where immersive virtual worlds represent the anchor of the user experience, virtual reality has also had its share of interest in exploring what’s possible with style transfer.</p>
  <p>While the applications with style transfer in VR are still largely in the research phase, the possibilities are exciting and promising. Facebook touts the potential of style transfer to radically alter the ways VR developers tell visual stories through their applications, games, films, and more.</p>
  <p>And there are some early demos that show how style transfer could help augment the immersiveness of worlds created for virtual reality. Here’s one example</p>

  <h2><a id = "Summary">Summary</a></h2>
  <p>It's very clear now how style transfer can play a role in the real world, and this technology isn't just limited to the four topics discussed here. With more and more people transitioning into the field of technology, style transfer will be more and more prevalent. </p>
  <p>However, that is only if people are able to learn this technique... [click here] to visit the the final part of this guide, which will cover resources for furthering your expertise in this exciting, new technique.</p>
